# RoyaltyStream

RoyaltyStream is a prototype platform designed to help creators track and receive royalties in real time. Built for musicians, filmmakers, podcasters, and digital artists, it aims to simplify royalty management and ensure instant, transparent payouts.

## Problem Statement

Creators often face delayed and opaque royalty payments from platforms and distributors. RoyaltyStream solves this by offering a streamlined system that tracks earnings and automates payouts using smart contracts and platform integrations.

## Key Prototype Feature

### Live Royalty Dashboard

This prototype demonstrates a real-time dashboard that displays earnings per stream, sale, or license. It simulates data ingestion from platforms like Spotify or YouTube and presents:

- Total earnings
- Earnings breakdown by platform
- Stream count and revenue per asset
- Simulated payout status

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (Vite)
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: PostgreSQL (simulated with mock data)
- Blockchain (planned): Ethereum smart contracts
- Payments (planned): Stripe, crypto wallets

## Future Plans

- Instant Payouts via digital wallets and bank transfers
- Smart Contracts for automated royalty splits
- Platform Integrations with Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music
- Advanced Analytics: geography, platform, content type
- Dispute Resolution tools for royalty conflicts
- Creator Profiles and IP ownership tracking
- API access for studios and agencies
